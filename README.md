# Settings We Use in Our Tooling

Welcome to our Git Repository on GitHub, where we manage and share the settings for various\* tools used across our projects.

\*Currently, this repository only contains the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) settings in the `vscode` folder. These settings help maintain consistency across our development environment and align with our project's coding standards.

## VS Code Settings

We have provided a detailed `settings.json` file that can be used to configure your VS Code instance to match our preferred setup.

- **Link to VS Code `settings.json` File**: [github.com/destacks/settings/vscode/settings.json](https://github.com/destacks/settings/vscode/settings.json)
- **Installation Guide**: If you wish to use these settings, please follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/destacks/settings/vscode/README.md) in the readme in the `vscode` folder.

## Future Enhancements

This repository will be expanded in the future to include settings and configurations for other tools we utilize in our workflows.
