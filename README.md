# Settings We Use in Our Tooling

Welcome to our Git repository (repo) on GitHub, where we manage and share the settings for various\* tools used across our projects.

**Link to the Git repo:** [github.com/destacks/settings](https://github.com/destacks/settings)

\*Currently, this repo only contains the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) settings in the `vscode` folder. These settings help maintain consistency across our development environment and align with our project's coding standards.

## VS Code Settings

We have provided a detailed `settings.json` file that can be used to configure your VS Code instance to match our preferred setup.

**Installation Guide:** [github.com/destacks/settings/blob/main/vscode/README.md](https://github.com/destacks/settings/blob/main/vscode/README.md)

## Future

This repo will be expanded in the future to include settings and configurations for other tools we utilize in our workflows.
